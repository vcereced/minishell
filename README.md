## &#x2728; What is minishell?

This project is about creating a own little shell. Capable of parsing a prompt and launching executables with arguments, along with a few built-in functions like Bash.<br />
It's two-person project was done by `vcereced` and `dgarizad` students of 42..

## &#x1F4BB; Usage

`make` to compile.

`make clean` remove .o files.

`make fclean` remove .o files and .a files and executable.

## &#x1F4D6; Examples

Execute this command in the terminal.

```bash
./minishell
```

Let's try some promps like in a shell:

```bash
echo "hello world" && cat
```

Output should be:
```bash
hello world
```
